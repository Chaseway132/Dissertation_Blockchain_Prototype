# Simulation-Based User Acceptance Testing

## Overview

This document presents the results of simulation-based user acceptance testing performed on the CharityDAO blockchain platform. The testing was designed to validate the system's reliability, effectiveness, and transparency from an end-user perspective.

## Testing Methodology

The testing methodology involved simulating real-world user interactions with the system through a series of test scenarios. Each scenario was designed to test specific functionality and user flows, with defined acceptance criteria.

### Testing Environment

- **Blockchain**: Local Ganache blockchain (simulating Ethereum)
- **Browser**: Chrome with MetaMask extension
- **Test Accounts**: 5 different Ethereum accounts with various roles (admin, donors, signers)
- **Test Period**: April 20-28, 2025

### Evaluation Metrics

The following metrics were used to evaluate the system:

1. **Functional Correctness**: Does the system perform its intended functions correctly?
2. **Transaction Transparency**: Are all transactions visible and verifiable on the blockchain?
3. **User Experience**: Is the interface intuitive and responsive?
4. **Security**: Are the security measures effective?
5. **Performance**: Does the system respond within acceptable time frames?

**Results**:

| Step | Expected Result | Actual Result | Status |
|------|-----------------|---------------|--------|
| 1 | Admin account connects | Admin account connected | ✅ Pass |
| 2 | Proposals page loads | Proposals page loaded | ✅ Pass |
| 3 | Proposal details display | Proposal details displayed | ✅ Pass |
| 4 | Signing initiates | Signing initiated | ✅ Pass |
| 5 | Timelock countdown displays | Timelock countdown displayed | ✅ Pass |
| 6 | Execution initiates | Execution initiated | ✅ Pass |
| 7 | Recipient balance increases | Recipient balance increased by proposal amount | ✅ Pass |
| 8 | Proposal marked as executed | Proposal marked as executed | ✅ Pass |

**Observations**:
- The signing process was secure, requiring authorized signers
- The timelock mechanism worked correctly, preventing immediate execution
- The execution process transferred funds correctly to the recipient
- The proposal status updated to "Executed" after successful execution
- The entire process was transparent and verifiable on the blockchain

### Scenario 4: Treasury Status Verification

**Objective**: Verify that the Treasury Status accurately reflects all donations and fund allocations.

**Steps**:

## Conclusion

The simulation-based user acceptance testing has demonstrated that the CharityDAO blockchain platform meets its intended requirements for reliability, effectiveness, and transparency. The system successfully:

1. **Records all donations and governance transactions** on the blockchain for verification
2. **Facilitates proper money transfers** between donors and beneficiaries after DAO approval
3. **Provides total transparency** with easily auditable transactions
4. **Displays accurate Treasury Status** showing all donations and fund allocations
5. **Implements secure governance mechanisms** for proposal creation, voting, and execution
6. **Prevents security vulnerabilities** such as reentrancy attacks

The implemented system achieves its purpose of ensuring total transparency with nothing to hide from anyone, making it easy for users to trust it. The DAO Treasury Status effectively shows the income of all donations made, visible to all stakeholders of the system.

Users can easily donate, view donation details, make proposals for various funding needs, and participate in decision-making through voting. The decentralized governance model ensures that no single entity has all the power to make decisions, enhancing transparency and trustworthiness.

Based on these results, the CharityDAO blockchain platform is validated as a reliable, effective, and transparent system for charitable fund management.
