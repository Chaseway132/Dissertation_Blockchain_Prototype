# Voting Period Fix Guide

This guide provides solutions for fixing the voting period issues in the application.

## Issues Fixed

1. Fixed duplicate declaration of `loadProposals` function
   - Changed first occurrence to `reloadProposals` to avoid duplication

2. Fixed `forceResetVotingEndTime` calls to include required second parameter
   - In ProposalList.tsx
   - In VoteButton.tsx (provided as VoteButtonFixed.tsx)

3. Added missing closing parenthesis in JSX

## How to Implement

### 1. Update VoteButton.tsx

Replace your existing VoteButton.tsx with the fixed version (VoteButtonFixed.tsx):

```bash
cp src/components/VoteButtonFixed.tsx src/components/VoteButton.tsx
```

### 2. Use utility functions for voting period fixes

The new utility file `src/utils/fix-voting-issues.js` provides helper functions:

- `extendVotingPeriod(proposalId)` - Extends voting period by 5 minutes
- `hasVotingPeriodEnded(proposalId)` - Checks if voting has ended
- `debugAllVotingTimes()` - Prints all voting times to console

## Testing

After applying these fixes:

1. Start the application
2. Check that vote buttons appear for all proposals, regardless of voting end time
3. If a proposal's voting time has ended, use the "Reset Time" button to extend it
4. Verify that votes can be submitted successfully

If you're still having issues, you can use the debug tools in the application:

1. Click "Show Debug" to access the debugging panel
2. Click "Force Stakeholder" to enable voting
3. Click "Reset Voting Time" on a specific proposal
4. Use "Sync Proposal Times" to update all proposals

## Technical Details

The root cause of the issue was:

1. Duplicate declaration of `loadProposals` function, causing compilation errors
2. Missing second parameter in `forceResetVotingEndTime` calls (should be the creation time)
3. Syntax error due to missing closing parenthesis

The fix ensures that voting periods can be properly extended, and the "Reset Time" button now properly uses the current time as the creation time parameter.
