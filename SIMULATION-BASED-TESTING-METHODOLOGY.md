# Simulation-Based Testing Methodology

## Overview

This document outlines the methodology used for simulation-based testing of the CharityDAO blockchain platform. The testing approach was designed to validate the system's reliability, effectiveness, and transparency through simulated real-world usage scenarios.

## Testing Approach

Simulation-based testing was chosen as the primary validation method for the CharityDAO platform for several reasons:

1. **Real-world Representation**: Simulations allow for testing scenarios that closely mimic actual user behavior
2. **End-to-End Validation**: The entire system can be tested as a cohesive unit
3. **User-Centric Evaluation**: The focus is on the user experience and system behavior from the user's perspective
4. **Blockchain Specificity**: The approach accounts for the unique characteristics of blockchain applications

## Testing Environment Setup

### Technical Environment

- **Blockchain**: Local Ganache blockchain (v2.13.2)
  - 10 pre-funded accounts with 100 ETH each
  - Block time: 15 seconds
  - Network ID: 5777
  - Gas limit: 6721975

- **Frontend**: React application (v18.2.0)
  - Connected to local blockchain via Web3.js (v1.8.2)
  - MetaMask integration for transaction signing

- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity (v0.8.20)
  - Deployed using Hardhat (v2.14.0)
  - Compiled with optimizer enabled (runs: 200)

- **IPFS**: Local IPFS node (v0.17.0)
  - Used for storing metadata and transaction details

### User Profiles

To simulate diverse user interactions, the following user profiles were created:

1. **Admin**: Platform administrator with full access rights
   - Account: 0x1057D3B61883f6b03aa115C6Fd826C76A21Fd8Df
   - Role: Deployer, owner, and administrator

2. **Regular Donors**: Users who make donations but don't participate in governance
   - 3 accounts with varying donation amounts (0.1-1.0 ETH)

3. **Stakeholders**: Users who donate and participate in governance
   - 3 accounts with donation history and voting rights

4. **Signers**: Authorized users who can sign and approve proposals
   - 2 accounts with signing privileges

5. **Beneficiaries**: Recipients of approved proposals
   - 2 accounts designated as fund recipients
