# Charity DAO Platform

A decentralized blockchain-based charity platform using DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) and smart contracts for transparency and trust.

## Features

- **Smart Contract-Based Donations**: Secure and transparent donation handling
- **DAO Governance**: Community-driven decision making for fund allocation
- **IPFS Integration**: Decentralized storage for proposal and donation metadata
- **Proposal System**: Create, vote on, approve, and execute charitable proposals
- **Treasury Management**: Transparent fund tracking and allocation
- **Web3 Integration**: Seamless blockchain interaction through MetaMask

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- MetaMask browser extension
- Git
- Ganache (optional, for alternative local blockchain)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Chaseway132/Dissertation_Blockchain_Prototype.git
   cd Dissertation_Blockchain_Prototype
   ```

2. Install dependencies for smart contracts:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd charity-dao-frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. Create a `.env.local` file in the `charity-dao-frontend` directory with your Pinata JWT:
   ```
   REACT_APP_PINATA_JWT=your_pinata_jwt_here
   ```

## Running the Application

You can use either Ganache (recommended for testing) or Hardhat Network (for development):

### Option 1: Using Ganache (Recommended for Testing)

1. Install and Start Ganache:
   - Download Ganache from [https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/)
   - Install and launch Ganache
   - Create a new workspace (or quickstart)
   - Note down the RPC Server address (usually http://127.0.0.1:7545)

2. Configure the network in hardhat.config.ts:
   ```typescript
   networks: {
     ganache: {
       url: "http://127.0.0.1:7545",
       accounts: { mnemonic: "your ganache mnemonic here" }
     }
   }
   ```

3. Deploy the contracts to Ganache:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network ganache
   ```

4. Connect MetaMask to Ganache:
   - Network Name: Ganache
   - RPC URL: http://127.0.0.1:7545
   - Chain ID: 1337
   - Currency Symbol: ETH

5. Import Test Accounts:
   - In Ganache UI, click on the key icon next to any account
   - Copy the private key
   - In MetaMask, click "Import Account" and paste the private key
   - You now have access to pre-funded test accounts

### Option 2: Using Hardhat Network (For Development)

1. Start a local Hardhat node (in the main directory):
   ```bash
npx hardhat node
   ```

2. Deploy the contracts (in a new terminal):
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network localhost
   ```

3. Connect MetaMask to the Hardhat network:
   - Network Name: Localhost 8545
   - RPC URL: http://127.0.0.1:8545/
   - Chain ID: 31337
   - Currency Symbol: ETH

### Starting the Frontend

1. Start the frontend application:
   ```bash
   cd charity-dao-frontend
   npm start
   ```

2. The application will automatically connect to whichever network you've configured in MetaMask

### Network Comparison

#### Ganache (Testing)
- Persistent blockchain state between restarts
- Visual interface for monitoring accounts and transactions
- Easy account management and private key access
- Better for testing and demonstration

#### Hardhat Network (Development)
- Fresh blockchain state on each restart
- Better debugging capabilities
- Console output for contract interactions
- Ideal for development and contract testing

## Using the Platform

### Making Donations
1. Connect your MetaMask wallet
2. Navigate to the Donations page
3. Enter the donation amount
4. Confirm the transaction in MetaMask
5. Your donation will be recorded on-chain and metadata stored on IPFS

### Creating Proposals
1. Go to the Proposals page
2. Click "Create New Proposal"
3. Fill in:
   - Title
   - Description
   - Recipient address
   - Requested amount
4. Submit the proposal
5. Metadata will be stored on IPFS for transparency

### Voting on Proposals
1. Browse active proposals
2. Click on a proposal to view details
3. Choose to vote "For" or "Against"
4. Confirm your vote transaction
5. The voting period lasts for the specified timelock duration

### Executing Proposals
1. Once a proposal passes voting:
   - The approval threshold is met
   - The timelock period has expired
2. Any member can execute the approved proposal
3. Funds will be transferred to the specified recipient

## Smart Contract Architecture

- `CharityDAOPlatform.sol`: Main contract coordinating all functionality
- `DonationTracking.sol`: Handles donation logic and tracking
- `ProposalManagement.sol`: Manages proposal creation and execution
- `VotingGovernance.sol`: Implements voting mechanisms
- `FundAllocation.sol`: Manages treasury and fund distribution

## IPFS Integration

The platform uses IPFS (via Pinata) to store:
- Proposal metadata
- Donation records
- Vote information
- Execution details

This ensures transparency and permanent record-keeping of all platform activities.

## Security Considerations

- All smart contracts are immutable once deployed
- Timelock mechanisms prevent rushed decisions
- Multi-step proposal process ensures careful fund allocation
- Transparent voting and execution process
- All transactions are permanently recorded on the blockchain

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues with Local Networks

1. **MetaMask Connection Issues**:
   - Ensure you're using the correct RPC URL and Chain ID
   - Reset your MetaMask account if you switch between networks
   - Clear your browser cache if you experience persistent issues

2. **Ganache-Specific Issues**:
   - Make sure Ganache is running before deploying contracts
   - Check if the mnemonic in your config matches Ganache's
   - Verify the RPC server is accessible (no firewall blocking)

3. **Hardhat Network Issues**:
   - Ensure no other process is using port 8545
   - Reset the Hardhat network if you encounter nonce issues
   - Clear MetaMask transaction history if needed

### Getting Test Ether

- **For Hardhat**: The default accounts come pre-funded
- **For Ganache**: Use the pre-funded accounts shown in the Ganache UI
- Import the private keys from either network into MetaMask to access the funds
